            <h2>OUR CORE PILLARS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Logistics</h3></li>
                <p>With end-to-end logistics capabilities and complete control over our supply chain, virtually any product is a click away. We have fulfillment centres across 17 Southeast Asian cities, and our investment in warehouses, sorting centres, and digital technologies complement our partner network and our cross-border and last mile arrangements in each country.</p>
                <li><h3>Technology</h3></li>
                <p>At Lazada, we harness both existing and emerging technologies to redefine the retail experience. Leveraging data in real time allows us to quickly adapt to changing demands and conditions. We connect consumers to brands, create customised experiences, and have evolved into a retail destination that customers come to for both shopping and entertainment. And we continue to push the boundaries. Project Voyager, our technology stack jointly developed with Alibaba, powers Lazada with the most scalable and competitive product and technology solutions for the next decade.</p>
                <li><h3>Payments</h3></li>
                <p>Ensuring secure and seamless transactions guides the development of Southeast Asia’s most secure payments and financial services infrastructure. In a region still at varying stages of e-payment and eCommerce adoption, we’ve evolved a suite of options that cater to existing preferences while easing customers into digital payments through intuitive solutions they can trust.</p>
